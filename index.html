      <ul><br>  <tab1>महिला व्यावसायिक प्रशिक्षण मंडळ (Women’s Vocational Training Board) was established to impart the vocational and technical skills to
      the girls and women to enable their participation in economic development of their family, society and nation.
      <br>
      <br>
      <tab1>Government of Maharashtra is the first State Government in India to formulate a women policy in 1994, which was subsequently revised in 2001.
      Our efforts are in line with this policy to provide participation, protection, economic development, capacity building and creation of a
      supportive environment for women.
      <br>
      <br>
      <tab1>We encourage women and girls to opt for the emerging technical education having high self-employment and employment potential.
      Women and girls are the foundation of every society. Yet for many women in India, life is extraordinarily difficult.
      Through innovative information, agricultural, business and education programs, WVTB builds on the courage and resourcefulness of
      girls and women to help them realize their potential and achieve economical development.
      <br>
      <br>
      <tab1>In India only 11.2% of female workers possessed marketable skills. Our objective is to provide the vocational skills to women and
      girls to suit the requirements of the unorganized sector, to prepare skills for self-employment, entrepreneurship, and
      income-generating work.
      <br>
      <br>
      <tab1>Vocational Training prepares learners for jobs that are based in manual or practical activities related to a specific trade. In
      recent years the governments are increasingly investing in imparting the vocational education through publicly funded training
      organizations and traineeship initiatives for businesses. Globalization made a great impact on requirements of skilled hands. The
      employability depends on their assets in terms of the knowledge, skills and attitudes they possess.
      <br><br>
      <tab1>The current globalization, liberalization and economic changes, there are new opportunities for employment for the skilled female
      workers. We offer a wide range of more than 100 programs designed especially for girls and women that are closely linked to local
      industry, business needs and self-employment skills.
